> Building the infrastructure for self-sustaining digital civilizations and intelligent content production systems.

## Overview

OneiraRadio is a collection of research initiatives and product designs exploring the intersection of AI, digital worlds, and productivity tools. The project encompasses three main research directions:

1. **Semantic World Models** - Infrastructure for digital civilizations
2. **CEO Helper Tools** - AI-powered content production and information systems
3. **Wonderland Settings** - Character and narrative frameworks

## Research Areas

### 1. Semantic World Models

**Goal:** Create a second habitable world - a self-sustaining digital civilization.

**Core Challenge:** Building the missing infrastructure layer that connects semantic understanding to physical simulation.

**The Problem:**
- Current AI doesn't understand actions like "throw the cup angrily"
- Dreamer-based models understand physics but not semantics
- LLMs understand semantics but not physical consequences
- There's no bridge between them

**Key Research:**
- Action primitives with style modulation
- Semantic-to-physics mapping mechanisms
- Continuous emotion intensity representation
- Protocol for physical laws in digital worlds

### 2. CEO Helper Tools

#### Project TT: Intelligent Content Production System

A complete content production platform for startup CEOs and content creators.

**Core Concept:** CEO focuses on thinking and decisions, the system handles content production.

**Key Features:**
- **Image Asset Library** - AI-powered tagging and smart search for company photos
- **WeChat Account Learning** - Auto-analyze writing styles from competitor accounts
- **CEO Diary** - Record thoughts, system suggests content topics
- **Smart Blog Generator** - One command to generate complete blog posts

**Modules:**
1. Image asset management with Claude Vision analysis
2. WeChat account monitoring and style extraction
3. CEO diary with intelligent content suggestions
4. Integrated blog generation with auto-illustration

**Timeline:** 3-month development plan, modular approach

#### Project XL: CEO Newspaper

Daily personalized industry digest for startup CEOs.

**Core Value:** Replace 1-2 hours of daily news reading with a 5-minute AI-curated digest.

**Features:**
- Auto-crawl articles from industry sources
- AI relevance scoring based on CEO profile
- Daily summary of key developments
- Competitor tracking
- Morning email delivery

**Business Model:**
- Personal: $99/month
- Team: $299/month
- 70%+ gross margin after optimization

**Status:** Feasibility validated, ready for MVP development

## Core Philosophy

### Building Infrastructure, Not Features

Rather than building individual applications, OneiraRadio focuses on creating foundational infrastructure:

- **For Digital Worlds:** Semantic-to-physics protocols
- **For Content Creation:** Integrated learning and generation systems
- **For Information:** Context-aware personalization

### AI as Collaborator, Not Tool

Systems that:
- Learn from examples (competitor analysis)
- Understand context (CEO's business situation)
- Make suggestions (content opportunities)
- Continuously improve (user feedback loops)

---

## Technology Stack

### AI/ML
- **Claude Sonnet 4** - Text analysis, content generation
- **Claude Vision** - Image analysis and tagging
- **DALL-E 3** - Image generation (when needed)

### Backend
- **FastAPI** - Web framework
- **PostgreSQL** - Primary database
- **Redis** - Caching and queues
- **Celery** - Async task processing

### Frontend
- **Vue.js / React** - Web interface
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling

### Infrastructure
- **Railway / Render** - Backend hosting
- **Vercel** - Frontend hosting
- **Cloudflare R2** - Image storage

---

## Development Roadmap

### Current Phase: Research & Design

**Completed:**
- Semantic world model research
- Content production system design
- CEO Newspaper feasibility analysis

**In Progress:**
- Validating product-market fit
- MVP development planning

### Near-term Goals

**Q1 2026:**
- CEO Newspaper MVP (hand-validated with 3-5 users)
- Basic content production tool
- Initial user feedback loops

**Q2 2026:**
- Full content production system
- Automated CEO Newspaper
- Integration between modules

## Key Innovation Areas

### 1. Semantic-Physical Bridge
Developing the missing layer that connects semantic actions to physical simulation in digital worlds.

### 2. Context-Aware Content Systems
Building systems that understand user context, learn from examples, and proactively suggest actions.

### 3. Closed-Loop Learning
- Learn from competitors (WeChat monitoring)
- Learn from users (CEO diary)
- Learn from feedback (continuous improvement)

### 4. Asset Reuse
- Company image libraries
- Historical context
- Style templates
